# box2d-tiny-travel

HELLO WORLD

THIS IS A VERY SMALL BOX2D physics EXPERIMENT
only use the box2dweb (+jquery)

INCLUDE TELEPORTER, TELEFERIK MAGNETIZER, BOAT WATER POOL
with many canvas effect animation.

Move the player with the left, right, up and down keys.
This is a very hard work for me to make it.
You will have a teleferik and a boat to make your tiny travel.

THIS IS A MAGNETIC TELEFERIK, THERE IS A SMALL MAGNET UNDER.
JUST WITH RIGHT AND LEFT KEYS YOU MOVE THE TELEFERIK. 
THERE IS SOME VIDEO BLOCKS ON THE ROOF, ACTIVATE THE MAGNET WHEN YOU ARE JUST ON A VIDEO BLOCK IT WILL BE MAGNETIZED
AND VIDEO WILL START.

Thank's to github, Thank's for reading.
